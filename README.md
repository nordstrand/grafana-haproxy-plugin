## Haproxy Panel Plugin for Grafana

The Haproxy Panel can show the current status of a Haproxy instance by directly getting data from the Haproxy stats URL.

### Options

- **12 or 24 hour**:

  Show time in the 12/24 hour format.
  
- **Offset from UTC**:

  This is a simple way to get the time for different time zones. Default is empty and that means local time (whatever that is on your computer). -5 would be UTC -5 (New York or central US)

- **Date/Time formatting options**:

  The font size, weight and date/time formatting can be customized here. If the seconds ticking annoys you then change the time format to HH:mm for the 24 hour clock or h:mm A for the 12 hour clock.

- **Bg Color**:

  Choose a background color for the panel with the color picker.
